# Checkbox

Checkboxes come with built in labels, so you dont have to worry about their alignment.

These checkboxes are modeled after native checkboxes in a variety of ways. The checkbox gets focus when clicked, but doesn't show this visually, just like a native checkbox in most modern browsers.
If you toggle it or navigate to it with teh keyboard it will however show the focus visually. The `indeterminate` is also independent of the value of `checked`.

<Preview inline>
	<CmCheckbox label="Check me!"></CmCheckbox>
	<CmCheckbox label="Uncheck me!" checked></CmCheckbox>
	<CmCheckbox label="I can't decide." indeterminate></CmCheckbox>
</Preview>

They can be disabled of course:

<Preview inline>
	<CmCheckbox label="Check me!" disabled></CmCheckbox>
	<CmCheckbox label="Uncheck me!" checked disabled></CmCheckbox>
	<CmCheckbox label="I can't decide." indeterminate disabled></CmCheckbox>
</Preview>
