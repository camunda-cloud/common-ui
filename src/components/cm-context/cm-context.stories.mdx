# Context

The Context component is meant as a central hub for configuring all components within it.
It is recommended that you use a **single** Context component on the top level of your application,
so that the same one is available for the other components to find.

There is no requirement for nesting, just as long as a cm-context tag can be found in the DOM somewhere.

Currently it only supports a single feature: Theming.
Every component will automatically listen to the Context component to find out about the set theme, and change itself automatically, where necessary.

**NOTE: Not every component is currently supporting the Dark Theme.**
