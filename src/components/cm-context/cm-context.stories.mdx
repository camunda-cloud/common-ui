# Context

The Context component is meant as a central hub for configuring all components within it.
It is recommended that you use a single Context component on the top level of your application,
so that the same one is available for hte other components to find.

Currently it only supports a single feature: Theming.
Every component will automatically listen to the Context component to find out about the set theme, and change itself automatically, where necessary.
NOTE: Not every component is currently supporting the Dark Theme.
