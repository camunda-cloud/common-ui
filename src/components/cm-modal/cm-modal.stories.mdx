# Modal

This Component represents a Modal window. It supports 2 positions: "center" for classic modals such as confirmation dialoges
and "top": which deals better with alternative use cases, like forms with expanding or contracting height needs.

It contains 3 slots: a default content slot, a "cancel" and a "confirm" slot. The latter 2 are meant to be used for buttons with their namesake functions.

**Note:** The modal only becomes visible when the `open` method is used.

The resulting promise resolves either to "confirm" - if the cm-button in the "confirm" slot is pressed - or to "cancel". <br/>
This can happen in a variety of ways: By pressing the `Esc` key, using the "Close" cm-icon-button in the top right, or pressing the cm-button (if provided) in the "cancel" slot.
