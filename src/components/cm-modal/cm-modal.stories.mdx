# Modal

This Component represents a Modal window. It supports 2 positions: "center" for classic modals such as confirmation dialoges
and "top": which deals better with alternative use cases, like forms with expanding or contracting height needs.

It contains 3 slots: a default content slot, a "cancel" and a "confirm" slot. The latter 2 are meant to be used for buttons with their namesake functions.

**Note:** The modal only becomes visible when the `open` method is used.
