# Notification Container

The NotificationContainer is a one stop shop for all your notification needs.
It handles everything: rendering and removing notifications after a set time,
staggering them such that only a limited amount is shown,
even enabling you to show a notification until you programatically dismiss it.

It has no visual appearance of its own, only defining the location that
Notifications are shown at. The current recommended position is the bottom left.
