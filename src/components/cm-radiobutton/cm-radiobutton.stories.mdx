# Radiobutton

Radiobuttons come with built in labels, so you dont have to worry about their alignment.

These Radiobuttons are modeled after native radiobuttons in a variety of ways. The radiobutton gets focus when clicked, but doesn't show this visually, just like a native radiobutton in most modern browsers.
If you toggle it or navigate to it with the keyboard it will however show the focus visually.

<Canvas>
	<CmRadiobutton label="Select me!"></CmRadiobutton>
	<CmRadiobutton label="I start selected!" selected></CmRadiobutton>
</Canvas>

They can be disabled of course:

<Canvas>
	<CmRadiobutton label="Can't select me!" disabled></CmRadiobutton>
	<CmRadiobutton label="Can't deselect me!" selected disabled></CmRadiobutton>
</Canvas>
