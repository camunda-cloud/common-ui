# Radiobutton

Radiobuttons come with built in labels, so you dont have to worry about their alignment.

These Radiobuttons are modeled after native radiobuttons in a variety of ways. The radiobutton gets focus when clicked, but doesn't show this visually, just like a native radiobutton in most modern browsers.
If you toggle it or navigate to it with the keyboard it will however show the focus visually.

<Canvas>
	<CmRadiobuttonGroup defaultValue="2">
		<CmRadiobutton label="Select me!" value="1"></CmRadiobutton>
		<CmRadiobutton label="I start selected!" value="2"></CmRadiobutton>
	</CmRadiobuttonGroup>
</Canvas>

They can be disabled of course:

<Canvas>
	<CmRadiobuttonGroup>
		<CmRadiobutton
			label="Can't select me!"
			value="1"
			disabled
		></CmRadiobutton>
		<CmRadiobutton
			label="Can't select me either!"
			value="2"
			disabled
		></CmRadiobutton>
	</CmRadiobuttonGroup>
</Canvas>
