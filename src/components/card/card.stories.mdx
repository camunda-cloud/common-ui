# Card

Cards are a primary way of sectioning content. They come in 2 primary varieties:

**Normal**

<Preview inline>
	<CmCard headline="A Normal Card Headline">
		<CmText>Hello from the Content!</CmText>
	</CmCard>
</Preview>

**Simple**

<Preview inline>
	<CmCard simple headline="A Simple Card Headline">
		<CmText>Hello from the Content!</CmText>
	</CmCard>
</Preview>

Cards also have more than just their default content `slot`. They also have a `slot` called `headline`,
which enables you to add arbitrary content to the right hand side of the headline.
The primary use of this `slot` should be for actions concerning the content of the card.
It is enabled for both styles of card, though strongly recommended to only be used with normal cards.

<Preview inline>
	<CmCard headline="Card Headline with Slot">
		<CmButton slot="headline" label="Button on the Right"></CmButton>
		<CmText>Hello from the Content!</CmText>
	</CmCard>
</Preview>
