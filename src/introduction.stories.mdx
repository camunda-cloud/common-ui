# Common UI

An easy-to-use, framework-agnostic design library, built with modern web standards.

## Goals

Common UI has a couple of goals, chief among them are:

- Leveraging web standards to stay framework agnostic
- Provide a simple and clear API
- Prevent invalid configuration of components
- Enable quick implementation of Designs

## Getting Started

### Select your Package

Depending on your framework of choice, there are different packages available for you:

All of these packages are hosted in the `@camunda-cloud` scope in the Github Package Registry.
In order to install packages from the Githup Package Registry you need to log into it. [Find out how](https://github.com/features/packages).

If you want to use the web components that are powering Common UI themselves, you want to install `@camunda-cloud/common-ui`.

If you are building your App in React you will most likely want to use the React-wrapper to these web components: `@camunda-cloud/common-ui-react`.
This is an automatically compiled set of very thin React wrappers around the web components - mostly to enable passing objects in attributes and
align with some naming conventions of React (a `cm-press` Event turns into `onCmPress` for example).

Similarly, `@camunda-cloud/common-ui-angular` is available to enable use of `ngModel`.

### Setting Up

Since Common UI is using web components, the CSS is bundled inside of all the components individually and contained inside their shadow-dom.
In order to reduce requests and prevent possible race conditions, font-related CSS has been placed in a global `common-ui.css` alongside all
CSS variable definitions (which all have been prefixed with `cm-` to avoid collisions).

This CSS file can be found under `dist/common-ui/common-ui.css` and needs to be manually included into your HTML.

**Note:** If you use either of the wrapper libraries, you still need to install `@camunda-cloud/common-ui` alongside it, to import this CSS file.

#### React

If you are using React, you are set up at this point. Just start importing the components you want to use from `@camunda-cloud/common-ui-react`.

#### Angular

If you are using Angular, you need to import the `CommonUIModule` from `@camunda-cloud/common-ui-angular` and add it to the imports of whichever
Module you want. We recommend the `app.module.ts` for a singular setup. Once this is done, you can start using Common UI like normal Angular modules.

#### Vanilla

If you are going with the vanilla Common UI experience you need add this bit of JS to your project:

```javascript
// NOTE: applyPolyfills is optional, feel free to just call defineCustomElements() if you are targeting evergreen browsers.
import {
	applyPolyfills,
	defineCustomElements,
} from '@camunda-cloud/common-ui/loader'
applyPolyfills().then(() => {
	defineCustomElements()
})
```

## Conventions

In order to stay as compliant with web standards as possible, this library refrains from reusing already standards-defined event names.
Every event name is thus prefixed with a `cm-`.

## Notes

This documentation is currently using `@camunda-cloud/common-ui-react` to keep code examples as brief as possible.
The technical documentation is based on the web component variants, which are the source of truth. The code examples are impacted in the following ways:

|            |            React            |            Angular            |              Web Components              |
| ---------- | :-------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
| Tag Names  |       `<CmButton />`        |   `<cm-button></cm-button>`   |        `<cm-button></cm-button>`         |
| Attributes | `<CmLink openIn="sameTab">` | `<cm-link open-in="sameTab">` |      `<cm-link open-in="sameTab">`       |
| Events     | `<CmButton onCmPress={fn}>` |  `<cm-button (cmPress)=fn>`   | `button.addEventListener("cmPress", fn)` |
